# LIFEWATCH - EFFECTIVELY MANAGING FIREFIGHTERS' CONDITIONS DURING EXECUTION

Firefighters face many stresses in their line of work, particularly physical stresses. This poses a danger to firefighters such as heat fatigue, shortage of oxygen and light-headedness, amidst other cases, and negatively impacts the effectiveness of the firefighting operation as well as the well-being of them. 

On the other hand, SCDF faces an outdated 'staging' practice which is a manual rotation system, thus leading to extra manpower wastage, and potential for human error. With LIFEWATCH, we've developed a prototype platform that uses XXX to measure XXX factors. This data is then used by a machine learning algorithm to predict the current physical condition of the firefighter and the need to withdraw the firefighter from the scene, all automated, no human error.

## Understanding LIFEWATCH in detail

See (link to Detailed Solution)



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
