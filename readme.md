# LIFEWATCH - EFFECTIVELY MANAGING FIREFIGHTERS' CONDITIONS DURING EXECUTION

Firefighters face many stresses in their line of work, particularly physical stresses. This poses a danger to firefighters such as heat fatigue, shortage of oxygen and light-headedness, amidst other cases, and negatively impacts the effectiveness of the firefighting operation as well as the well-being of them. 

On the other hand, SCDF faces an outdated 'staging' practice which is a manual rotation system, thus leading to extra manpower wastage, and potential for human error. With LIFEWATCH, we've developed a prototype platform that uses XXX to measure XXX factors. This data is then used by a machine learning algorithm to predict the current physical condition of the firefighter and the need to withdraw the firefighter from the scene, all automated, no human error.

 

One Paragraph of project description goes here

1. README.md
    Your README.md should contain:
    a) A short description of the problem you are tackling, how technology can help, as well as the idea your team is proposing*
    c) The architecture of your proposed solution*
    d) A hyperlink to your detailed solution* (Long description of your solution)
    e) Project Roadmap/ Proposed timeline
    f) Getting started* (Step-by-step instructions to install the required software and how to run a demo of your solution)
    g) Running the tests (Explanation and breakdown on how to run tests for the proposed solution)
    h) Live demo (Link to an actual working demo/website)
    i) What your team used to build your solution* (e.g. IBM Cloudant, IBM Cloud Functions, etc...)
    *Items marked with an asterisk are compulsory



## Challenge Statement

Climate change is inevitable, with projected increase in temperatures leading to phenomena such as the Urban Heat Island effect. This leads to an environment and climate where it is increasingly physically challenging for First Responders to train and operate to maximum efficiency and performance. How might SCDF leverage wearables or other technologies to provide relief or enhancement in harsh operating conditions and maximise the safety, health and performance of First Responders during training and operations?



## Our Solution

LIFEWATCH is based on these features:

1. [The sensor](throw the link of the readme)
2. IBM IoT Platform
3. Node-RED
4. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
5. Dashboard



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.



## Understanding LIFEWATCH

Our pitch video is attached below, explaining our solution: LIFEWATCH

(Attach Video Here)



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
