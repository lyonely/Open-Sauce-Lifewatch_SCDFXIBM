# Solution

## The Problem:

There are many problems that SCDF firefighters face in their training and actual practice.

These problems include:

1. **<u>SCDF uses an outdated practice - ‘Staging’ - within the Rota system (rotation system)</u>**
   - Rotation of personnel is done using manual timing of each person’s time spent in hazardous environments and tracked on a whiteboard. A person is tasked to keep track of who went in and call them out when they have reached the limit.
2. **<u>Constant training incidents of heat fatigue in the SCDF</u>**
   - According to anecdotal evidence, it is common to see personnel suffering from heat fatigue and having to visit the hospital during training sessions, a lot due to the lack of effective management of personnel.
3. **<u>Firefighters are unable to control their breathing well when stressed, and in many cases, they may use too much air</u>**
   - This is a problem because firefighters use air cylinders with a 45min period of effectiveness before they have to rotate with other personnel due to air shortages. They may end up having a shortage of oxygen before the 45min period due to constant breathing, thus posing a hazard for the firefighter.



## The Solution:

We propose the usage of IoT to tackle the 3 problems highlighted above.

1. <u>**SCDF uses an outdated practice - ‘Staging’ - within the Rota system (rotation system)**</u>

**OUR SOLUTION:**

We propose that the rotation system needs to be better automated to reduce human error of tracking and recording timing of firefighters, and to provide a more accurate judgement of the conditions of the personnel. 

Thus, we propose a platform that can track the entry and exit timing of each firefighter using wearable technology.

Key Features:

- Wearable technology such as smartwatches to be activated when firefighter begins breathing from oxygen tank.
- Entry time to begin recording when wearables is activated.
- System should prompt the individual through the wearable closer to 45 minutes to begin evacuating the premises.



2. **<u>Constant training incidents of heat fatigue in the SCDF</u>**

**OUR SOLUTION:**

We propose that the wearable technology proposed earlier be able to give an accurate judgement of the conditions of the personnel. We should use variables such as heart rate which can be detected by wearables to determine the current physical condition of the individual, and give a rating for the physical condition.

This rating should be used by operations officers to determine to rotate personnel more effectively.

Thus, we propose a platform that can track the physical conditions of each firefighter using wearable technology.

Key Features:

- Wearable technology such as smartwatches to be activated when firefighter begins breathing from oxygen tank.
- Wearables track the physical factors of the firefighters. Such factors are:
  - Internal Conditions - Heart Rate 
  - Internal Conditions - Temperature of Firefighting Suit 
  - External Conditions - Temperature of Environment 
  - External Conditions - Humidity of Environment
- Based on the conditions, the system will flag on the dashboard for the operations officer the current colour rating (status) of each firefighter, allowing the operations officer to make decisions.
- The wearable will also indicate to the firefighter of his current condition and make the necessary relay to the team IC.
